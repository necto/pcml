In the first [project](http://icapeople.epfl.ch/mekhan/pcml15/project-1/index.html), we implement
several classic regression and classification methods, such as:
 - linear regression through gradient descent,
 - least squares,
 - ridge regression;
and
 - logistic regression with gradient descent,
 - logistic regression through the Newton method,
 - penalized logistic regression.

And then try to apply them to the data given in the data/ folder.
